introduction: |
  This beginner blueprint introduces the Serial terminal over USB. You'll learn how to
  open a serial monitor and use a Particle Cloud function to print messages for quick debugging.
description: |
  The firmware initializes USB Serial at 9600 baud and registers a cloud function called `printMsg`.
  When invoked from the Particle Console (optionally with an argument), the device prints a
  timestamped message to the terminal. This provides a simple, reliable pattern for interactive debugging.
